# 42-piscine

My 42 C Piscine experience from 18.10.21 to 14.11.21

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a
methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is
approved in its selection process. The so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
is the last stage in the selection process for becoming 42's student.
